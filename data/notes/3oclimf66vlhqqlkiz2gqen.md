## Goals

### Learning Outcomes

- Develop skills using robots and fabrication methods
- Apply critical design skills to a more-than-human context
- Introduce students to novel concepts
  - Interspecies design
  - Multispecies place
    - Capabilities framework
- Develop collaboration skills supported by teaching material
  - Introduce practical workflows for agonistic design

### Deep Design Lab

- Use Dendron as a teaching tool
  - Possible research outcomes
- Integrate material from Lab subjects and projects
  - Resources about interspecies design, multispecies place, digital design, fabrication, and LIDAR scanning
- Use the Place & Colour project as a teaching tool
  - Multispecies place
  - Sensing and capabilities framework
- Generate data about teaching interspecies design concepts
  - For internal use
  - For future research outcomes
- Develop existing and new partnerships
- Integrate Lab projects as teaching modules, e.g., as guest lectures, design frameworks

## Components

## Implementations

### [[admin.drafts.subject-overview.design-build]]

- Adapted from our draft proposal
- Class works as a group
  - Initial proposals in groups
  - Individual reflective journal

#### Schedule

- Group
  - 4 weeks research and design
  - 2 weeks scoping
  - 4 weeks build
- Individual
  - 2 weeks reflection

#### Assessment

- Assessment
  - Pre-Project
    - Students design and fabricate a practical tool
    - Integrate learning about fabrication, robots, and concepts with concrete task
- Main Project
  - Design
  - Scoping
  - Build
  - Reflect

#### Benefits

- Develop advanced collaborative skills
  - Supported by teaching content
- Group work allows serious engagement with all phases
  - Better use of contact hours by reducing individual commitment
