We are not experts in biology or ecology.\n\n## It's not like this in practice\n\n- This lazy response shirks responsibility. We will introduce you to a range of methods for collaborating.\n  - Collaborative design emphasises competition, and the individual over understanding, empathy and [[generative conflict|resources.concepts.collaboration.generative-conflict]]\n  - Educating students about these principles produces conscientious designers.\n- In practice, you sometimes need to work quickly with others. Debating the merits of *your* design wastes time and energy. We challenge you to think instead about *our* design. Conscientious debate minimises conflict and hours spent producing multiple designs.\n\n## We prioritise reflection not perfection\n\n- Reflection promotes conscious collaboration.\n- Understanding collaboration styles allows parties to identify unproductive dynamics and move forward without offending one another.\n","n":0.063}}},{"i":13,"$":{"0":{"v":"Brief","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Design, plan and build an installation for the System Garden\n  - Design and build a project in groups that can support the Main Project\n","n":0.2}}},{"i":14,"$":{"0":{"v":"Assessment","n":1}}},{"i":15,"$":{"0":{"v":"Reflective Journal","n":0.707}}},{"i":16,"$":{"0":{"v":"Pre Project","n":0.707}}},{"i":17,"$":{"0":{"v":"Main Project","n":0.707}}},{"i":18,"$":{"0":{"v":"Resources","n":1}}},{"i":19,"$":{"0":{"v":"References","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## [MSD Robotics Lab](https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/maker-spaces/robotics-lab)\n\n## [Deep Design Lab Wiki](https://wiki.deepdesignlab.online/)\n\nFor the learning component of this course we rely heavily on the [Deep Design Lab wiki](https://wiki.deepdesignlab.online/).
