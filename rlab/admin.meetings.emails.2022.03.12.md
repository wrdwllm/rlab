## Rochus Hinkel

### Subject overview

- 6 week design build using interspecies design
- Runs over winter break
- Coordinate with FabLab and System Garden
- Coordinators identify funding sources for students to contact
  - Funds for materials from FabLab, MSD, staff payments, private donations in exchange for publicity, etc.
    - Student contributions as last resort (discouraged)
  - Students prepare budget
- Non-human client (*bryophyta* taxa, i.e., mosses)
  - Provide [[persona|resources.concepts.persona]] based on William's independent thesis
    - [ ] Adapt thesis content

### Collaborators

- Seek advice from Bower Studio coordinator David O'Brien
- Contact Tim Uebergang and Andrew Gay (System Garden curator and director) to discuss project viability and required commitment
- City of Melbourne
- [Deep Design Lab](https://wiki.deepdesignlab.online)

### Key questions

- What are the requirements for proposing a subject?
- Is the subject feasible?
- Is the assessment aligned with department standards?
- Does the subject align with Design program priorities?
- Is there overlap with other subjects?
- What staff members or researchers would be interested in the subject outcomes?
- Can you suggest funding sources, collaborators, guests, etc.?
- What funding can the MSD and FabLab provide?

#### Conceptual framing

- [ ] Adapt and insert the standard Lab argument for interspecies design projects @wrdwllm
- [ ] Update to reflect [[course ethos|subject.introduction]]
- Frame as a [[design experiment|resources.concepts.design-experiment]]
  - Coordinators and students accept that the experiment produces useful data regardless of success.
  - Alignment with Deep Design Lab goals guarantees research interest.
- Subject teaches sustainable collaboration and conflict resolution and provide practical resources for students.
  - Draw on psychology and team management concepts, e.g., [[modules for working in groups|resources.modules.working-in-groups]]
    - [[resources.concepts.collaboration.generative-conflict]] and [[resources.concepts.collaboration.agonism]]
- Students experience [[interdisciplinary collaboration|resources.concepts.collaboration.interdisciplinarity]] and identify skills needed to facilitate information exchange.

#### Future development

- First iteration of the course serves as a demonstrator
- Future iterations build on first project
- Use first iteration to argue for funding and collaborators
- Plan for monitoring and research
  - Identify collaborators with an interest in the installation
    - Design researchers, ecologists, biologists, University staff, etc.
    - Conference papers, journal articles, presentations, etc.

### Assessment

#### Reflective Journal

- Students produce an individual journal documenting their contributions
- Emphasis on how a student resolved an issue, e.g. decisions about budget, material choice, resolution of a detail, construction, etc.
  - Document the issue's context, risks and benefits.
  - Reflect on resolution, group dynamics, and suggest improvements.

#### Class Journal

- Students develop a printed booklet documenting the final [[subject.assessment.main-project]] and [[subject.assessment.pre-project]]
  - As a group, reflect on successes, failures, and suggest improvements.

#### Pre-project

![[subject.assessment.pre-project]]

- Students identify inefficiencies (e.g., wastage, efficiency, bottlenecks, group dynamics) and roadblocks (material availability and cost, individual schedules, )

#### Main Project

![[subject.assessment.main-project]]
