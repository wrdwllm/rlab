## This is an experiment
This is a [[design experiment|teaching.concepts.experiment]]. We are investigating new concepts. We will make mistakes. Our design may be incompete or may not work at all. The key outcome is your learning, which is captured in your [[reflective journal|assessment.reflective-journal]].

This is also a teaching experiment. We have done our best to prepare a structure and learning materials to guide you, but we may fail too. To compensate, we mark generously. If we can see your work satisfies the [[learning outcomes|teaching.learning-outcomes]], we will give you appropriate credit.

## This is the beginning of a long process
- Our prototype can demonstrate to other disciplines that this work is worth pursuing.
  - As the designers, we want you involved in the lifecycle of this project. If these concepts excite you, stay involved.

## This is weird
- Interspecies design is a new idea. We are not experts in biology or ecology.

## It's not like this in practice
- This lazy response shirks responsibility. We will introduce you to a range of methods for collaborating. 
    - Collaborative design emphasises competition, and the individual over understanding, empathy and [[generative conflict|teaching.concepts.collaboration.generative_conflict]]
    - Educating students about these principles produces conscientious designers.
- In practice, you sometimes need to work quickly with others. Debating the merits of *your* design wastes time and energy. We challenge you to think instead about *our* design. Conscientious debate minimises conflict and hours spent producing multiple designs.

## We prioritise reflection not perfection
- Reflection promotes conscious collaboration. 
- Understanding collaboration styles allows parties to identify unproductive dynamics and move forward without offending one another.
